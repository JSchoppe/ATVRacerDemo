# ATV Racer Demo
A technical demo for ATV time attack style gameplay. With this project I am exploring vehicle physics
from the ground up to build a better understanding of the driving principles of vehicle simulation. This
demo does not use the built in Unreal vehicle API or chaos vehicles API.

// TODO add demo screenshots here.

<summary>Project Goals</summary><br>

With this project I am looking to further cement knowledge from the following areas;
- General C++ and Unreal flavor C++
- Understanding of vehicle simulations and equations
- Tuning physics gameplay to be easy and fun to control
- Tuning surface traction to create enjoyable surfaces to drive on
- Implementing replays with deterministic physics

An important design goal is focusing on fun pick up and play gameplay.
Understanding vehicle simulation is a secondary goal, but realism should be limited/removed
if it does not serve the gameplay.
